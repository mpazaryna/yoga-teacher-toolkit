### Opening and Setting Context (3 minutes)

  - Practice/Reflection: Take a moment to reflect on a time when you showed compassion towards someone or received compassion from another.

### Main Teaching Points (18 minutes)

  - Key Message: Empathy allows us to connect with others' pain and respond with care and kindness.
  - Example/Story: The story of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara who hears the cries of the world and manifests countless arms to help all beings.
  - Practice/Reflection: Reflect on a challenging relationship and consider how you can respond with compassion and understanding.

### Practice or Meditation Guidance (6 minutes)
- Guided Compassion Meditation
  - Key Message: Meditation can deepen our capacity for compassion by cultivating a sense of connection and care.
  - Example/Story: The practice of Tonglen where we breathe in the suffering of others and breathe out compassion and healing.
  - Practice/Reflection: Follow along with a guided meditation focusing on compassion for yourself, loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and all beings.

### Closing and Integration (3 minutes)
- Compassion is a practice that requires patience, consistency, and a willingness to open our hearts to the suffering of the world.
  - Key Message: As we cultivate compassion, we contribute to a more peaceful and harmonious world.
